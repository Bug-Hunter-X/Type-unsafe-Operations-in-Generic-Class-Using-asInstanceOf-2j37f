This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala: using `asInstanceOf` for type-safe operations within a generic class.  The `Bug.scala` file showcases the problematic code, where the `myMethod` uses pattern matching and `asInstanceOf` to handle addition for Int and String types.  However, this approach is unsafe and throws an exception for any type other than Int or String. The `BugSolution.scala` file provides a more robust solution.
